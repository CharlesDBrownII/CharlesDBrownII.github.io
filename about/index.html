			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Dr. I earned my B.S. with honors in physics at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Under the guidance of Prof. Jack Harris, I earned my Ph.D. in physics at Yale University, where I performed experiments with superfluid-helium-filled optical cavities, and with magnetically levitated drops of superfluid helium in vacuum. I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the Stamper-Kurn group in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. I recently wrote a piece for Physics Today about Black underrepresentation in physics, which has been widely read and continues to spark important conversations regarding necessary changes in the physics community.
