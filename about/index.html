			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I earned my B.S. with honors in physics at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
			Under the guidance of <a href="https://harrislab.yale.edu/">Prof. Jack Harris</a>, I earned my Ph.D. in physics at Yale University, where I performed experiments with superfluid-helium-filled optical cavities, and with magnetically levitated drops of superfluid helium in vacuum.
			I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://ultracold.physics.berkeley.edu/">Ultracold Atomic Physics Group</a> in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, led by Prof. Dan Stamper-Kurn. 
			I recently wrote a piece for <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20200720a/full/">Physics Today</a> about Black underrepresentation in physics, which has been <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.3.20201218a/full/">widely read </a> and continues to spark important conversations regarding necessary changes in the physics community.
			I am also a lead organizer of Black in Physics Week, a week dedicated to celebrating Black physicists and their myriad contributions to the scientific community, but also to revealing a more complete picture of what a physicist looks like.
