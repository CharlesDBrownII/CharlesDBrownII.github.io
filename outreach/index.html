					#BlackInPhysicsWeek is a week, hosted on multiple social media platforms, that is dedicated not only to celebrating Black physicists and our contributions to the scientific community, but also to reveal a more complete picture of what a physicist looks like.
					Our 2020 work has been featured in many media outlets: <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.4.20201026a/full/">Physics Today Magazine</a>,
					Physics World Magazine (<a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/blackinphysics-week-set-to-celebrate-black-physicists/">here</a> and <a href="https://physicsworld.com/p/collections/blackinphysics/">here</a>) 
					<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-01140-9">Nature Physics</a>,
					<a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/blackinphysics-week-to-build-community-increase-visibility">Symmetry Magazine</a>, and

					We seek to strengthen intergenerational connections between physicists in the #BlackandSTEM community, encourage long-lasting collaborations among ourselves and allies, and further push for the development of supportive environments where current and future Black physicists can thrive.
					In addition, we seek to enhance science literacy within the Black community via engaging communication of physics research, and by inspiring future Black physicists across the world.
